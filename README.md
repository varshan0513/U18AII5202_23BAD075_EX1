Visualization of Academic Performance Indicators using R

**Objective**

To analyze and visualize the internal assessment performance of first-year engineering students across multiple subjects using appropriate data visualization techniques in R.

**Software & Tools Used**

R Version: 4.4.1

R Packages:

ggplot2

dplyr

tidyr

**Dataset Description**

File Name: 1.student_performance.csv

**Description:**
The dataset contains student internal assessment details including:

Roll Number

Subject

Internal Test 1 Marks

Internal Test 2 Marks

Assignment Marks

Final Grade

**Steps Performed**
1. Load Required Libraries

The necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization are loaded using library().

2. Import Dataset

The dataset is imported into R using the read.csv() function.

3. Data Preprocessing

An additional column Average_Marks is calculated by averaging Internal Test 1, Internal Test 2, and Assignment marks.

4. Data Visualization
a) Bar Chart – Subject-wise Average Marks

Displays the average internal marks for each subject.

Helps identify subjects with lower overall performance.

b) Line Chart – Performance Trend Across Tests

Shows the trend of average student performance across internal tests.

Useful for understanding improvement or decline in performance.

c) Pie Chart – Grade Distribution

Represents the distribution of final grades among students.

Helps visualize overall academic outcomes.

**Output Generated**

Bar Chart with subject-wise average marks

Line Chart showing performance trend across tests

Pie Chart showing grade distribution

**Conclusion**

The visualization techniques used in this experiment effectively highlight subject difficulty, performance trends, and grade distribution. Such analysis helps academic institutions identify weak areas and improve teaching strategies.

**Notes**

Warning messages related to package build versions do not affect execution.

Rtools is not required as binary packages are used.
